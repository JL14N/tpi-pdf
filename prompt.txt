Let's change the approach, since I don't think cookies exfiltration is actually viable. But it _can_ make HTTP requests from the browser, OpenAction, submitForm() or app.launchURL with the active session cookies from the vulnerable domain. The pdf should contain a link to the same page so that the form makes a POST request to the same site, executing an action on behalf of the admin who opens it (like changing the email address, for example). Ensure the site is vulnerable enough so that this action succeeds. It's meant to showcase CSRF/IDOR/authorization.
